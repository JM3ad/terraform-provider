# Initial provider setup
Provider originally set up [following the docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/registry/publish-providers).

This roughly included:
* Set up the relevant Terraform Cloud account & organisation
* Set appropriate environment variables, and run the create provider script with `poetry run create`
* Generate a GPG key
*
